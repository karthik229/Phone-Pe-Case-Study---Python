PhonePe Digital Payments Case Study
Overview
This repository contains the analysis and insights derived from the PhonePe Digital Payments case study. The case study involves analyzing transaction data and demographic details across various states and districts in India, using Python for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Datasets
The analysis utilizes multiple datasets stored in Excel format:

state_txn_users_df: Transaction and user data at the state level.
state_txn_split_df: Breakdown of transaction types at the state level.
state_device_data_df: Device brand usage data at the state level.
district_txn_users_df: Transaction and user data at the district level.
district_demographics_df: Demographic details for each district.
Tasks Completed
The analysis covers several tasks including:

Data loading, understanding, and preprocessing.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover transaction trends, device usage patterns, and demographic correlations.
Data quality checks to ensure consistency and reliability.
Advanced analysis including merging datasets, calculating ratios, correlations, and visualizations.
Generating insights and recommendations based on the findings.
Key Findings
Transaction volumes are highest in states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.
Xiaomi and Samsung are popular device brands across various states.
Higher population density correlates with increased transaction volumes.
App engagement peaks during festive seasons and promotional periods.
Recommendations
Implement targeted marketing strategies based on regional transaction preferences.
Optimize app performance for popular device brands like Xiaomi and Samsung.
Focus on expanding services in densely populated urban areas.
Enhance customer segmentation to personalize services and increase engagement.
Continuously monitor trends and adapt strategies to maintain competitiveness.
Usage
The Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks provided can be used to replicate the analysis and explore further insights from the data.
